# ColorSynth

Standalone application that enables users to edit the colours of their SynthV singer tracks.
ColorSynth done by OSformula (http://osformula.com/)
.svp files belong to Dreamtronics (https://dreamtonics.com/)

Note: This software has been done in an evening so it could be done way faster
if I knew how Windows Forms works but this will do the trick for now.
If any of the copyright holders wants me to take it down, I will without any problem
